-- Through deduction, if we look for which name is common to all query results thus far, we can see that only Bruce appears in each set of results.
-- Therefore we can assume based on the evidence at hand, that Bruce was the thief!

-- Now we are confident the thief was Bruce we can form a query that looks for him specifically on the earliest flight for the day after the robbery.
-- From there we can return the name of the city for the destination airport.
