Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?:

That with each 10x increase of N, the time to execute may also increase 10x, it did not follow that trend, it was exponential rather than linear.

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?:

Probably 10'000 as that seems to offer a balance between accuracy and compute time.
This is because at this number the exponential increase in compute time is beginning to ramp up.
However the accuracy of the simulated percentages is still comparable to the higher numbers of N within a percentage or less.
